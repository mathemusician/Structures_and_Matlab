# Structures_and_Matlab

I've combined the Matlab genetic algorithm with Blender and Python to find the optimal structure for any project (almost)

Dependencies:  
  
  1) Matlab 2017 B   
      a) pde toolbox   
      b) global optimization toolbox   
  2) Python 2.7 and Python 3.x  
  3) Blender 2.79   
  

## In order to work, you have to change lines 37, 75, 76, and 93 in change_stl.py and lines 11, 16, 17, 18, 23, and 28 in return_pde.m

To do:

  1) Should reduce the number of lines that need to be changed
  2) Should be generalized to move vertices within constraints from the center of gravity
