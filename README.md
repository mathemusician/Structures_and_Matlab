# Structures_and_Matlab

I've combined the Matlab genetic algorithm with Blender and Python to find the optimal structure for any project (almost)

Dependencies:  
  
  1) Matlab 2017 B   
      a) pde toolbox   
      b) global optimization toolbox   
  2) Python 2.7 and Python 3.x  
  3) Blender 2.79   
  
In order to work, you have to change lines 37, 75, 76, and 93 in change_stl.py and lines 11, 16, 17, 18, 23, and 28 in return_pde.m.

To do:
  Should reduce the number of lines that need to be changed.
  Should be generalized to move vertices within constraints from the center of gravity.
